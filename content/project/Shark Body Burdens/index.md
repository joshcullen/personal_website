Through multiple routes of introduction, aquatic environments are the ultimate sink for many organic contaminants. Of these compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are among the most ubiquitous. Previous studies in wildlife have  demonstrated a variety of impacts due to specific classes of these compounds, including immunosuppression, endocrine disruption, reproductive impairment, genotoxicity, and metabolic disruption.

Sharks may be particularly susceptible to contaminant accumulation and exposure since they have large, fatty livers that can serve as a large reservoir for the accumulation of organic contaminants, in addition to their biomagnification as contaminant concentrations increase up the food web. Bull (*Carcharhinus leucas*), blacktip (*Carcharhinus limbatus*), and bonnethead sharks (*Sphyrna tiburo*) were sampled from Galveston Bay, Texas and were measured for concentrations of PAHs and PCBs. Additionally, enzymatic biomarkers of contaminant exposure were also measured within shark liver to determine if there was a relationship between the accumulation of PAHs and PCBs with that of different biotransformation pathways.

Over longer time periods, bull sharks had the highest concentrations of PCBs followed by blacktip and then bonnethead sharks. Concentrations of PAHs were comparable across all species over long time periods. These results indicate that bull sharks (and blacktip sharks to an extent) are accumulating high concentrations of PCBs, which may be at levels high enough to induce negative health effects. Contrary to previous ecosystem-wide studies, it appears that these sharks did not rapidly biotransform PAHs since they all had relatively high concentrations in their tissues. This affect may be a result of constant exposure to these compounds, which these sharks may either be less sensitive too or their biotransformation enzymes cannot keep up with the high uptake of PAHs compared to excretion from the body. Only a small number of specific PAHs and PCBs were correlated with the biotransformation enzymes (EROD and GST). EROD and GST activity were both high in bonnetheads, which suggests that this species may still be vulnerable to the health impacts of PAHs and PCBs that accumulate in the sediment where they feed for benthic crustaceans.
