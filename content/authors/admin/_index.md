I am a postdoc in [Denis Valle's lab] (http://denisvalle.weebly.com) developing new Bayesian methods to identify underlying behavioral states from animal movement. In general, my research takes an integrative approach to understand how animals interact with their environment.

This includes using different types of data (morphological, performance, diet, toxicology, movement) to model resource use within a single species, how this may change as it gets older/larger, and how this compares against potential competitors. I am interested in using climate change projections to evaluate the ecological niche of species and how this may impact food web dynamics.
